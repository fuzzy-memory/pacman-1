# Pacman

Collaborated with three team members to recreate the arcade sensation, Pacman. Roles included the designing of all the visual elements, testing some use cases  and contributing to the documentation. The sprites were created using Adobe Illustrator and animated using Adobe Photoshop. The game was written in Java and employed a modified A* pathfinding algorithm within the constraints defined in the original dossier of the game.
